This is a custom control for Styles based on @bradyvercher's [subsection custom control](https://github.com/bradyvercher/twentythirteenme/blob/master/includes/customize-controls.php).

When the plugin is active, type `group` in customize.json will display as a sub-section header.

### Example usage

`{ "type": "group", "label": "Amazingness" },`
